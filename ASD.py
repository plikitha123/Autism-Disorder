    - ASD is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins in early childhood and lasts throughout a person's life.
    - Common symptoms include difficulty with communication, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests.
    - Early diagnosis and intervention can help individuals with ASD improve their quality of life.
    
    **Causes and Risk Factors:**
    - Genetic factors
    - Environmental influences
    - Differences in brain structure and function
    
    **How is ASD Diagnosed?**
    - Clinical assessments and behavioral observations
    - Standardized ASD screening tests
